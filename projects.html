                    iOS game – Swift – Challenge me</a>
                As part of the curriculum of the subject Mobile Applications we made own mobile application with the help of mentors. We could either do an iOS app or using Cordova a multi-platform app as that was our course work. Challenge me is the app I came up with. In short it’s a game that you can play with your friends, it gives you challenges and if you don’t complete the challenge it gives you a punishment.

                    Unity 2D Game – Scripting C# – Project Genesis</a>
                I was in charge of creating the scripts that allowed our space shuttle to move, land, and interact with the asteroids and pretty much anything else that had to be coded. Our team was one of the few from Macedonia that was chosen to participate in the global NASA Space App Challenge and we accomplished our goal and had the finished game at the end of the 3 day event after more than 35 hours of non-stop coding, 7 cups of coffee and 3 red bulls.

                </a>
                I was in the 24 people that were chosen to participate from Macedonia in this international one week Advanced Skills Workshop for mobile application development in which we had world announced lecturers and had to develop our interactive Jamb Game.  At the end I had to present the finished project or more correctly pitch the game in front of a group of investors, professors and colleagues. It was an incredible learning experience as I was more oriented to the business and marketing side of the area this time around.
