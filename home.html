                At IAESTE, I am in charge of maintaining the local branch’s web site. But since I was offered the
                position of IT Coordinator I’ve gathered a small team and we began working on a completely new website
                that I had to design, program, coordinate and ultimately ‘make happen’. I used material design with a
                clean, modern focus on detail. And we decided it would be in WordPress as it allows a very user friendly
                interface that is easy to modify and maintain on a daily basis.

                The websites they manage are based on the Contao content management system (http://contao.org).
                The Contao team has recently released version 4.0.0 and the summer’s internship focus was on porting of
                \most of the websites they manage (many of which run Contao 2.11 or 3.1) to the new version. This
                involved setting up
                virtual machines via Virtual Box with the required server, installing and setting up a Symfony framework
                with the
                necessary bundles using Composer and manually transitioning all the modules into bundles through a
                custom made
                repository. And finally using in one case Apache and in another NGINX running the new website on the
                local host.

                During the summer of my first year of college I was an intern at the MSE for almost three months. During
                this period I was introduced to the way a web site with many integral parts functions and how it is
                maintained and added to. Though what I gained most from the experience was an extensive knowledge for
                designing and building Android Mobile Applications in Android SDK Eclipse (Java). We developed a
                real-time news feed app - SEI Net, which allowed you to get the latest information directly to your
                phone. You can see the finished product here.

                Firefox Club @ FCSE and Mozilla Macedonia in collaboration with Mozilla organized a Firefox OS Crash
                course on the 10.05.2014. The target was to introduce the students to the programming environment for
                developing a Firefox OS Mobile App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By the end of the day the
                participants had made their first Firefox OS simple To Do application. We had a great turn up and had a
                lot of fun and all those months of planning were well worth it.

                what it takes to make a huge two day event with more than 250 participants, 15 speakers and 20 lectures
                and workshops happen. A lot. It was single handedly the biggest thing I had the pleasure of being a part
                of creating. We set out to inspire and motivate young people and in the end we were overwhelmed by the
                positive response and praise that I’ve never felt more inspired myself and more motivated to keep
                helping and providing new opportunities for young people in my community.
